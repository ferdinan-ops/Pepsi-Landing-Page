# Pepsi Landing Page
Hello, this is a landing page project that I made with the Pepsi theme referring to the design from the YouTube creator which is just an exercise for me because I want to make a landing page design that is quite interesting for me, but I don't intend to develop it so this landing page opens for anyone who wants to develop it because this landing page is still not fully functional.

<h2>What I Used</h2>
<ol>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>VS Code</li>
</ol>
